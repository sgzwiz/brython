    <h3>Introduction</h3>

    Welcome to a tutorial/primer on frontend web development with Python! The intended audience for this document is somebody with some other CPython experience (Or other implementations. I know CPython best). An in-depth understanding of the language is not necessary. Basic knowledge of html tags will help, but even without that, a small amount of googleing and common sense will make everything presented clear.
    <p>

    Most frontend web development is done in JavaScript. All major browsers support JavaScript. Brython aims to be a viable alternative for JavasSript. Brython works by compiling python syntax to JavaScript, which can run in the browser. Details of this process are largely irrelevant to this article. Since Brython is a complete replacement for JavaScript, we need talk of JavaScript no more! That's right, there will be no JavaScript used in this tutorial.
    <p>
    Everything you need to develop in Brython is included in this document or readily available on most computers.
    <p>
    Tools you will need to provide are a text editor. I use Sublime Text 2, and highly recommend it. Notepad++ is a free and cross platform editor.

    <p>
    And that's it for your part.
    <p>
    This tutorial will start by getting you set up and looking at the DOM and some basic html, and then dive right into the python.
