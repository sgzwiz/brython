== Problem ==
----
Access elements in the HTML document


== Solution ==
--------------
{{{
<html>
<head>
<script src="brython.js"></script>
</head>
<body>

<div id="zone">this is a DIV element</div>

<script type="text/python">
elt = doc["zone"]
elt.text = "new text"
</script>
</body>
</html>
}}}

An element can be accessed by its attribute `id` with the Python dictionary syntax `doc[elt_id]`

Elements such as DIV have attributes `text` and `html` representing its inner text and inner HTML code. These attributes can be set as shown in the code above to change the element inner text
